# Operating System: compter is made up with hardware->cpu, memory, storage, i/o devices. 

## application don't know how to talk to hardware
## application like browser can't be installed directly on the hardware
## operating system is an intermediary can innteract with computer hardware
## manages recources among application
## isolates content of application

# Tasks of an OS

## Resource allocation and management
### Process management
#### Process is a small unit that executes on a computer
#### each process has own isolate space

### memory management
#### allocation working memory
#### every application needs some data to work
#### ram is limited on the computer
#### os swaps memory between applications
#### one app become inactive, new one gets resources
#### memory swaping slows computer
		
### storage management
#### also called secondary memory
#### persistinng data long-term
#### hard drive
#### stored in a structured way
#### in uniix system: tree file system
#### in winsdows os: multiple root folders
		
### Management of i/O devices
#### os knows how to handle ad translate interactions between apps and devices
	
### Security & Networking
#### managing user and permission
#### each user has a permission
#### each user has a space
#### networking port and ip address


## Operating system components

### Hardware like cpu, ram, memory etc.
### Kernel E.g. Linux karnel
		
#### Linux Kernel
##### this the part that loads first & heart of every operating system
##### kernel is program 
##### consists of devices drivers, dispatcher, scheduler, file system etc.
##### manages external devices
##### kernel starts the process for app
##### allocates resources to app
##### cleans the resources when app shtus down
##### kernel can be interact whit graphical user interface and command line interface 
		
### Application layers
	
#### differents linux distriputations like ubuntu, mint, centos, debian
#### different application layers, but based on same linux kernel
#### Android is also baased on linux kernel
#### mac OS and iOSon a  different kernel called darwin
#### Operating syetem for servers
##### Mostly based on linux
##### more light-weight and performat
##### no gui or other user applications
### 3 main operating system Linux, windows and macOS
#### each os has many version kernel stays the same
#### linux and windows have server distributions
#### server opetating system are more light weight use the hardware reources more efficiently
#### no user interface or i/o devices
#### Unix was the COdebase for many different os developed in 1970 sets a standared called posix
#### if a operating system runs in a computer this should implements sets of api and functions
#### Poxis is the most popular Portable Operating Syetem Interface
#### many os build on thp of unix
#### MacOs originaly came form osx 
#### linux was developed independently in 1991 by Linux Torvalds
#### no source code of Unix
#### clone of unix or called "Unix Like"
#### linux and macos both posix compliant
