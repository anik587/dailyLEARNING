# What is a linked list data structure?
A linked list is another common data structure that complements the array data structure. Similar to the array, it is also a linear data structure and stores elements in a linear fashion.

However, unlike the array, it doesn’t store them in contiguous locations; instead, they are scattered everywhere in memory, which is connected to each other using nodes.

A linked list is nothing but a list of nodes where each node contains the value stored and the address of the next node.

Because of this structure, it’s easy to add and remove elements in a linked list, as you just need to change the link instead of creating the array, but the search is difficult and often requires O(n) time to find an element in the singly linked list.

This article provides more information on the difference between an array and linked list data structures.

It also comes in varieties like a singly linked list, which allows you to traverse in one direction (forward or reverse); a doubly-linked list, which allows you to traverse in both directions (forward and backward); and finally, the circular linked list, which forms a circle.
